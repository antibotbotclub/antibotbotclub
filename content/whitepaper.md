# Abstract

__*NOTE: The whitepaper is work-in-progress and will be updated.*__

we build anti-bots.

## Problem

bots. 


## Solution

Fight automation with automation.

By deploying anti-bots we aim to battle bots on their own domain. Human interactions are no longer fast enough to counter the bots. 

In addition to the development of anti-bots we will fund security research through the tokenomics of the $ABBC token.

## Tokenomics

The complete tokenomics will be shared shortly. As mentioned above, a part of the $ABBC pool will be used as funding for research. Read more on the [Tokenomics](/tokenomics) page.
